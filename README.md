# Employee Break Time Scheduler

## Overview

This application is designed to automatically assign break times for employees based on the data they provide through a web page. The core functionality is powered by a mathematical optimization algorithm, and the user interface is implemented using Vue.js. The backend is developed in Rust with WebAssembly to ensure optimal performance.

## Features

- **Automatic Break Time Assignment:** The application intelligently assigns break times for each employee, optimizing for factors such as workload distribution and individual preferences.

- **Web-based Interface:** Users can easily input their information through a user-friendly web page built with Vue.js. The frontend provides a seamless experience for interacting with the application.

- **Efficient Backend:** The backend is implemented in Rust, leveraging WebAssembly for high-performance computation. This ensures that the optimization algorithm runs swiftly, even with a large number of employees.
